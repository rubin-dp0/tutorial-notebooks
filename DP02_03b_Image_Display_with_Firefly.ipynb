As in the complementary \"Image display\" notebook, we will use the Butler to access images. We will also use the `lsst.afw.display` library to display images, but in this case with a different \"back end\" -- the interactive Firefly display tool.\n",

Again, see the tutorial section linked above for more about this flag and an example of its usage.\n",
