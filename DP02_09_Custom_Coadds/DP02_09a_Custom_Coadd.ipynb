    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to retrieve information about the individual images that contributed to a deepCoadd, and how to make a new \"custom coadd\" image using only a subset of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past you might have used IRAF's imcombine or AstrOmatic's SWarp (for example) to coadd images.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the appropriate method for coadding LSST images with the LSST Science Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Science applications of coadding a subset of LSST images include searching for faint, slowly-evolving transients or variables (e.g., coadding images by season), using the effects of differential chromatic refraction (e.g., coadding images in bins of airmass), or searching for low surface brightness features (e.g., coadding only dark-time images with the faintest sky backgrounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adopted science use case for custom coadds: supernova precursor events.**<br>\n",
    "This notebook tutorial uses the science case of a hypothetical supernova that occurred at RA 55.745834, Dec -32.269167 on MJD = 60960.\n",
    "(There is no DC2 supernova there, we just use the coordinates as an example).\n",
    "Since the deepCoadds are made out of years worth of images, and are combined to remove most transient flux, the supernova itself would not appear in the deepCoadd.\n",
    "However, some supernovae are known to have faint precursor eruptions, and characterizing precursor events is useful for understanding the supernova progenitor star and, e.g., its pre-supernova mass-loss episodes.\n",
    "It could be possible to detect faint precursor eruptions by stacking images obtained prior to the supernova explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats for the adopted science use case.**<br>\n",
    "1. This science use case of supernova precurors would be much better achieved by stacking the difference images. However, we wanted to make this a tutorial that creates custom coadds, and our science background is supernovae. So there remains a bit of a mismatch between science use case and image type for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This tutorial uses only i-band visits to recreate coadds, but in reality scientists looking for supernova precursor events would use all filters (searching the bluer filters in particular would be more relevant).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This tutorial uses images obtained in a one-month window prior to the supernova, but in reality scientists looking for supernova precursor events would use more windows, further in the past. That is left as an exercise for the learner in Section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The simulated DC2 supernovae were all of Type Ia and no precursor events were simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source detection in custom coadds.**<br>\n",
    "See the next tutorial notebook in the series, 09b_Custom_Coadd_Sources.ipynb, to learn how to run source detection and measurement on the new custom coadd."
