    "This notebook demonstrates how to access the simulated Data Preview 0.3 (DP0.3) data set in the Rubin Science Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the DP0.3 simulation, only moving objects were simulated, and only catalogs were created (there are no images).\n",
    "The DP0.3 simulation is *entirely independent of and separate from* the DP0.2 simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "DP0.3 is a hybrid catalog that contains both real and simulated Solar System objects (asteroids, near-earth objects, Trojans, trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and even a simulated spaceship... but no major planets nor the Moon).\n",
    "See the <a href=\"https://dp0-3.lsst.io\">DP0.3 documentation</a> for more information about how the hybrid catalog was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rubin Operations, these tables would be constantly changing, updated every day with the results of\n",
    "the previous night's observations.\n",
    "However, for DP0.3, both a static 1-year catalog and a static 10-year catalog have been simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notice:** To re-iterate, for DP0.3, there are tables available for both the 1-year and 10-year catalogs.  For the remainder of this notebook, though, unless otherwise noted, we will just consider the tables for the 10-year catalog.  Users are encouraged to explore the tables for the 1-year catalog on their own.\n"
