    "\n",
    "Some source detection and measurement details come from Robert Lupton's [Tune Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/blob/master/Demos/Tune%20Detection.ipynb) and [Kron.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/blob/master/Demos/Kron.ipynb).\n",
    "Interaction with `lsst.afw.display` was also improved by studying Michael Wood-Vasey's [DC2_Postage Stamps.ipynb](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/blob/master/tutorials/dm_butler_postage_stamps.ipynb).\n",
    "More information on footprints can be found on the Stack Club notebook by Imran Hasan [here](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/blob/master/SourceDetection/Footprints.ipynb).\n",

    "   3. Examine the `footprint` of the detected sources.\n",
