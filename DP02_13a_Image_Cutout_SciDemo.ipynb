    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will teach how to use the cutout service (which enables users to retrieve small image cutouts from LSST data) by demonstration of a few basic science applications. Since LSST images are quite large, in some cases it is desirable to be able to perform operations (e.g. image cutouts) on the server side to avoid transferring large amounts of data. This can speed up visual inspection and other analyses requiring images of individual objects or fields that may be much smaller than the patch and tract sizes that are created by the LSST camera and pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://www.ivoa.net/\">International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)</a> co-ordinates the community efforts of astronomical missions and archives to develop and maintain the Virtual Observatory (VO) standards. The VO standards enable interoperability between astronomical archives. IVOA also provides a <a href=\"https://www.ivoa.net/documents/SODA/20170517/REC-SODA-1.0.html\">Server-side Operations for Data Access (SODA)</a>, which is a protocol for remote data processing operations. This protocol allows users to perform computations (pixel operations, image transformations, etc) on the remote server, which avoids unnecssary data movement. The LSST architecture has a \"VO-first\" approach, meaning that VO standards are implemented in all applicable services, enabling the use of VO tools such as the image cutout service to access LSST data. The procedure is to identify the remote web location of the image of interest (called a datalink), and use a web service that creates a cutout from that linked data remotely, to transfer and save locally on the Rubin Science Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIX THIS: Further demonstration of the technical side of this process using DP0.2 data can be found in (Leanne's companion tutorial when published, link here). Further details and information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataLink/20211115/WD-DataLink-1.1-20211115.html\"> the IVOA data link documentation</a>, where it says Access Data Services. Rubin-specific documentation for these can also be found in <a href=\"https://dmtn-238.lsst.io/\">this document describing the RSP DataLink service implementation strategy</a>. \n",

These shape definitions do not produce circle or polygon cutouts, but rather are methods for defining the edges of cutouts with 4 sides. In the case of circle, the resulting cutout is always a square, with edge size that is the same as the circle diameter. In the case of a polygon, either a square or a rectanglar cutout will result, depending on whether the length and width edge dimensions are different values. Only cutouts with 4 corners and 90 degree angles are supported. \n",

The angular distance on the sky that defines the circular cutout size already accounts for the difference in angular distance in the RA direction is smaller by a factor of cos(declination), where declination is in units radians. The difference increases with higher declination. However, the polygon definition does not automatically account for this cosine factor. Thus, circle and polygon cutout definitions using the same cutout edge length will not match size in the RA direction (for deepCoadds, the x-axis).

    "## 3. Science application: validating a galaxy sample based on color-color selection \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will demonstrate a simple example of a science use-case for the Rubin Image Cutout Service. Lyman-break color selections are a common way to identify galaxies at high redshifts. The selections make use of the absorption by intergalactic hydrogen in the foreground of all galaxy light blueward of the Lyman limit (912A) or at very high redshifts, Lyman-alpha (1216A). <a href=\"http://candels-collaboration.blogspot.com/2012/08/how-to-find-distant-galaxies.html\">More details about why this works can be found at this blog-post.</a> DP0.2 includes mock galaxies up to redshift (z) of 3, where the Lyman-break falls between the LSST u and g bands. Such galaxies can be identified by their very red u-g colors, and since intergalactic hydrogen absorbs all the light blueward of the Lyman break, true z~3 galaxies should be undetected in the LSST u-band. The cell below will perform a search for redshift of 3 galaxies as u-band dropouts, and will create cutouts in each of the LSST filters in order to visually inspect the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates to confirm the real candidates show no u-band flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 The u-band dropout LBG color selection\n",
    "To search for $z\\sim3$ LBGs in DP0.2, first define a u-band color selection based on the existing literature that uses filter sets similar to that of LSST. Below outlines the set of colors used in Steidel et al. 2003 (see also Boutsia et al 2014, among other references. Many selections exist, where changes to colors would alter the redshift selection function, or may differ due to differences in the broad band filter shapes of other instruments).\n",
    "\n",
    "U − G >= (G − R) + 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "G − R <= 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where capital letters U, G, and R indicate the total AB magnitudes in the LSST filters u, g, r. Since DP0.2 is only 5-year depth mock data in the LSST filters, our search will also include a g-band magnitude that is relatively bright (G < 24.5 ABmag) in order to obtain high-quality candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "High redshift galaxies are typically small in size. For this exercise, use aperture photometry with a relatively small aperture diameter (9 pixels) in order to obtain high S/N measurements and exclude neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1 Ammending a typical search because of the rarity of z~3 galaxies in the mock data.\n",
    "The mock galaxies that go into DP0.2 are created using the LSST Catalog Simulator (<a href=https://www.lsst.org/scientists/simulations/catsimcatSim>catSim</a>), and are based on an empirical model of the evolution of galaxies outlined in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06530\">Korytov et al. 2019</a>. The input model is based on realistic number densities, fluxes, and redshift distributions across cosmic time, and utilizes the UniverseMachine methodology to assign empirical properties (see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07893\">Behroozi et al. 2019</a>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically at any redshift, bright galaxies are rarer than faint galaxies, which are much more common. And typically in any patch of the sky, nearby galaxies will be much more common above the detection limit of a survey than distant $z\\sim3$ galaxies. This means that $z\\sim3$ galaxies that are bright enough to meet the criteria we want (G$ < 24.5$) will require a large search area to identify a statistical sample. So, in this example, we will first identify a parent sample of bright (G < 24.5) galaxies over a very large area (4 degrees) to ensure the parent sample contains enough rare distant galaxies.\n",

    "The next cells create a plot of the U-G vs G-R colors of the parent sample, and identify the high-redshift galaxy candidates based on the color selection discussed above. For sources with low S/N fluxes in u-band, we cannot robustly recover the U-G color, and instead we get a lower limit on how red it is (owing to the upper limit to the u-band flux). Thus, the U-G color can be overestimated if the u-band flux is not significant. Thus, sources with low S/N u-band flux will be reset to an error floor that corresponds the noise level of the u-band imaging so that it's color is not overestimated. To do this, define a new parameter called `umag` to store the u-band magnitude for assessing colors. In this case, if sources have signal to noise less than 1 in U_band, umag will instead hold the `umagErr` from the object table)."

    "In the above plots, it is clear that the calexp image orientations are not aligned with each other, because the calexp images are not necessarily all taken in the same position angle on the sky. The cell below will go through each dia source, identify the calexp file in which it was identified, and create cutouts (as above) except now they will all be aligned with each other. At the same time as creating these new aligned fits files for each cutout, the cell will create png files that will be useful for visualizing the transient behavior (to be used in Section 4.3).\n",
