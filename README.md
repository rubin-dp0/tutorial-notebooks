Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks for Data Preview 0, created and maintained by the Rubin Observatory Community Engagement Team.

<br>

| Title  | Description  |
|---|---|
| 01. Intro to DP0 Notebooks | Use a python notebook; query a DC2 catalog and plot data; retrieve and display a DC2 image. |
| 02. Intermediate TAP Queries | Query, and retrieve DC2 catalog data with the Table Access Protocol (TAP) service. Use bokeh and holoviews to create interactive plots. |
| 03. Image Display and Manipulation | Display and manipulate DC2 images, explore image mask planes, create cutout and RGB images. |
| 04. Intro to Butler | Discover, query, retrieve, and display DC2 images and catalog data with the Generation 3 Butler. |
| 05. Intro to Source Detection | Use the LSST Science Pipelines tasks for image characterization, source detection, deblending, measurement, and to interact with a source footprint. |
| 06. Comparing Object and Truth Table | Retrieve and merge data from the DC2 Object and Truth-Match tables, and compare simulated and measured properties. |
| 07. *(time-domain tutorial)* | *Coming Soon* |
| 08. Interactive Image Visualization | Use Bokeh, Holoviews, and Datashader to plot very large datasets. |

These tutorials are subject to change, as the Rubin Science Platform and the LSST Science Pipelines are in active development.

The `prod` branch will appear in IDF RSP users' home directories.

Additional tutorials might be added as the [DP0 Delegates Assemblies](https://dp0-1.lsst.io/dp0-delegate-resources/index.html) series progresses.

More DP0 documentation can be found at [dp0-1.lsst.io](https://dp0-1.lsst.io).
