## Advisories

The tutorials in this repo will only work on the Rubin Science Platform deployed at the Interim Data Facility for Data Preview 0.

The tutorials in this repo are subject to change, as the Rubin Science Platform and the LSST Science Pipelines are in active development.

DP0.2 tutorial notebooks 09a and 09b can only be used with uncached RSP Image "Weekly 2022_40".

Branches `main` and `prod` will usually match, except for short periods of time when updates from multiple development branches are being collected in `main` before "releasing" updated notebooks in a single PR to `prod`.
It is the `prod` branch which appears automatically in IDF RSP users' home directories.
Any user who obtains this repository with `git clone` can switch from `main` to `prod` using `git checkout prod` to ensure they are using the "released" versions.

The documentation for DP0 can be found at [dp0-2.lsst.io](https://dp0-2.lsst.io) and [dp0-3.lsst.io](https://dp0-3.lsst.io).
