    "\n",
    "This tutorial, together with tutorial `08b_Interactive_Catalog_Visualization`, introduces three open-source Python libraries that enable powerful interactive visualization of images and catalogs. \n",
    " 1. [**HoloViews**](http://holoviews.org): Produce high-quality interactive visualizations easily by annotating plots and images rather than using direct calls to a plotting library\n",
    " 2. [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.org): A powerful data visualization library that provides interactive tools including brushing and linking between multiple plots. `Holoviews` + `Bokeh`\n",
    " 3. [**Datashader**](https://datashader.org): Accurately render very large datasets quickly and flexibly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These packages are part of the [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem of tools intended for visualization in a web browser and can be used to create quite sophisticated dashboard-like interactive displays and widgets. The goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction and starting point from which to create more advanced, custom interactive visualizations. Holoviz has a [vibrant and active community](https://discourse.holoviz.org/) where you can ask questions and discuss vizualizations with a global community. "

    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on `data.lsst.cloud`. Note that occasionally the notebook may seem to stall, or the interactive features may seem disabled. If this happens, usually a restart of the kernel fixes the issue. You might also need to log out of the RSP and start a \"large\" instance of the JupyterLab environment. In some examples shown in this notebook, the order in which the cells are run is important for understanding the interactive features, so you may want to re-run the set of cells in a given section if you encounter unexpected behavior. Note that some of the examples require manual selection of points on a graph to run correctly."
