    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of astronomical surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), \n",
    "a significant objective is to extract cosmological information by scrutinizing subtle deviations in the \n",
    "shapes and orientations of galaxies. \n",
    "These deviations are caused by gravitational lensing from large-scale structures in the foreground. \n",
    "However, the observed shapes of galaxies are not solely influenced by the gravitational lensing effects \n",
    "of the universe's large-scale structure (referred to as \"cosmic shear\"), \n",
    "but also by a combined blurring effect known as the point spread function (PSF). \n",
    "The PSF arises from various factors such as atmospheric conditions (for ground-based instruments), \n",
    "telescope optics, and the image sensor.\n",
    "PSF analysis is thus an integral part of cosmological studies (and is important in other astronomical fields as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the introductory DP0.2 PSF tutorial notebook (DP02_12a_PSF_Data_Products) demonstrated how to access\n",
    "PSF information for `calexp` and `deepCoadd` images, this tutorial focuses on the measured PSF information\n",
    "that is available in the `Source` and `Object` catalogs for sources detected in the `calexp` and `deepCoadd`\n",
    "images, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2** introduces and explores the PSF measurements that are available in the `Object` and `Source` catalogs.\n",
    "Two TAP queries are executed: one to retrieve a set of `Objects` detected in the `deepCoadd` images,\n",
    "and one to retrieve a set of `Sources` detected in a `calexp` (single visit) image at the same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3** calculates and displays the size of the PSF in a particular photometric band (`i`) as a function of sky location. \n",
    "It also computes the size-size two-point correlation function (autocorrelation) using the `treecorr` software. \n",
    "This software is widely used in state-of-the-art weak lensing analyses to derive cosmological parameters. \n",
    "These calculations are performed using both `calexp` and `deepCoadd` images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4** illustrates one chromatic dependence of the PSF: the wavelength dependence of the PSF size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 5** calculates the rho statistics, a series of two-point correlation functions used to diagnose \n",
    "the quality of a PSF model for weak lensing analyses. This calculation is done using the `lsst.analysis.tools` framework."

For the latter, the gradient observed is dominated by Kolmogorov turbulence, demonstrating the turbulent seeing variation across the focal plane. These variations are averaged down in the case of the `deepCoadds`, and therefore the correlation function decreases faster with distance. Both are in the `i` band in this case, and as a consequence, there are no chromatic variations in size coming from effects such as Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) or the seeing dependence with wavelength, which will be explored in the next section."

    "## 4. The wavelength dependence of seeing  \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct for the effects of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and to deduce the weak lensing signal (referred to as \"shear\") from galaxy shapes, the PSF is typically modeled using stars, often bright ones. Subsequently, the PSF of galaxy images is deconvolved by utilizing the estimated PSF convolution kernel. Implicit in this methodology is the assumption that the convolution kernel for galaxies remains the same as that for stars. However, this assumption becomes invalid if the PSF varies with wavelength due to the distinctive Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of stars and galaxies, resulting in disparate PSFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, use the point source sample derived from the `Object` catalog, which was obtained in the preceding sections. Aftwerward, compute one of the wavelength-dependent components contributing to the PSF owing to atmospheric effects: the wavelength dependence on seeing. As per the standard theory of atmospheric turbulence, the linear dimension `θ` of the atmospheric convolution kernel (i.e., seeing) is inversely proportional to the wavelength, expressed as $\\theta \\propto \\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{5}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional wavelength-dependent contributions to the PSF encompass Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR), telescope diffraction, variations in the absorption length of camera CCDs, and optical chromatic aberrations. In general, each of these factors exhibits distinct functional wavelength dependencies and may exert dominance in different spectral bands. Nevertheless, the wavelength-dependent seeing that we explore in this section tends to be the primary contributor to the PSF. These chromatic PSF effects introduce biases in observables such as photometry, astrometry, measurements of galaxy shape and size, and higher-order moments of the PSF. Addressing these effects is imperative for precise cosmological analysis employing weak gravitational lensing.

    "As explained in [Jarvis et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/abstract), `rho1` (ρ1), `rho3` (ρ3), and `rho4` (ρ4) represent direct systematic errors in `xi+` (ξ+) with leading coefficients of order unity. `rho2` (ρ2) and `rho5` (ρ5) describe the extent of \"PSF leakage\" that occurs during the shear measurement process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DC2 area is relatively small and does not exhibit significant PSF variations. The `rho` statistics obtained in the previous examples (for the `i` band, considering that `rho` statistics can vary with different bands) are relatively small and well-behaved. For comparison, you can refer to Figure 26 of the [HSC Y3 shape catalog](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74..421L/abstract) and Figure 12 of the [DES Y3 shape catalog analyses](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/abstract), which display `rho` statistics obtained from on-sky data from their respective galaxy surveys (HSC Survey and DES). These figures also include the requirements that each `rho` statistic should satisfy (e.g., Eq. 37 of [Li et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74..421L/abstract)) to ensure that there are no significant PSF modeling systematic errors that would impact the scientific goals related to cosmic shear."

    "1. Calculate the PSF ellipticity using the definition based on the second moments, as described in section 7 of [Jarvis et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/abstract). Create plots similar to those in section 3 to visualize the PSF ellipticity variation across the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify the query in section 2.1 to retrieve both point sources and extended sources. Create a size-magnitude diagram using the definition of size from section 2.1 (trace radius). Identify the region in the diagram where the size is constant, representing likely stars during the star-galaxy separation process. Compare your results with Figure 3 in [Jarvis et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify the query in section 2.1 to retrieve the required catalog fields according to the input schema for the `RhoStatistics` of `analysis_tools`. Calculate the `rho` statistics for a different band, such as the `g` band. Note that chromatic effects, including Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) and wavelength-dependent seeing, have a larger impact in the bluer bands. Use the `rho` statistics as a diagnostic tool to assess whether observations in these bluer bands should be included in weak lensing analyses (refer to the discussion in section 7.4 of [Jarvis et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1282J/abstract))."
