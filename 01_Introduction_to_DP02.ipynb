    "\n",
    "**How do I emergency-stop a notebook?** If a code cell is taking a long time to execute (for example you accidentally tried to retrieve an entire catalog or tried to print 100,000 rows) and you need to kill it, go to \"Kernel\" in the top menu bar and select \"Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs\". It might still take a few tens of seconds, but it will stop the process and restart the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can I quickly execute all the cells?** Go to the top menu bar and select \"Kernel\", then \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a kernel?** The kernel is the computational engine for the notebook. In this case, we are using a Python3 kernel. You can think of the kernel as a live compiler. Restarting the kernel means that all defined variables or functions are removed from memory, and all code cells revert to an \"unexecuted\" state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can I view a table of contents for this notebook?** Click on the icon of a bullet list in the leftmost vertical menu bar, and an automatically-generated ToC will appear at left. Click on the icon of the file folder at the top of the leftmost verticle menu bar to return to a directory view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which version of the LSST Science Pipelines am I using?** Look along the bottom bar of this browser window, and find the version of the LSST Science Pipelines that was selected as the \"image\". It is probably \"Recommended (Weekly yyyy_ww)\", and it should match the verified version listed in the notebook's header. Alternatively, uncomment the two lines in the following code cell and execute the cell."
