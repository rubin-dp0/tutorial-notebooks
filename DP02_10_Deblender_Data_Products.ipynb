    "\n",
    "This notebook is an introduction to the data products that are associated with the deblending process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build its source catalog and measure photometry of objects in images, the LSST Science Pipeline uses the multi-wavelength deblending algorithm Scarlet (<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....24..129M/abstract\">Melchior et al. 2018</a>) to identify independent detected components within source blends and separate the flux from independent objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"**parent**\" source is identified as a region of connected pixels above a given signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the `deepCoadd` image.\n",
    "These regions are called footprints.\n",
    "Each footprint may have one or more peaks, and it is these peaks that the deblender will use to infer the number and positions of objects blended in each footprint.\n",
    "The deblended sub-peaks are referred to as \"**children**\" of the parent in the properties saved by the deblender in the `Object` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scarlet deblender separates the flux among components by modeling the flux and shape of each source making up the blend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will identify a heavily blended parent object with many children and explore how to interpret the deblender-related measurements in the `Object` table.\n",
    "It will also demonstrate how to use deblender-related columns in the `Object` table to identify unique deblended child sources, and\n",
    "provide an example of how to access metadata that is available for each deblended source (e.g. the deblended footprints and pixel-weight maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional resources\n",
    "\n",
    "An introduction to all of the available deblending flags, and the processes that produce the deblender data products discussed in this tutorial\n",
    "can be found in this <a href=\"https://pipelines.lsst.io/modules/lsst.pipe.tasks/deblending-flags-overview.html\">overview of the deblending flags</a>.\n",

    "A general discussion of blending impacts to LSST can be found in this article titled \"<a href=\"https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2021/pub/fermilab-pub-21-598-ppd.pdf\">The challenge of blending in large sky surveys</a>\" by Melchior et al. 2021. \n",
