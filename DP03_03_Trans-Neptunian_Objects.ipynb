    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What are Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A trans-Neptunian object (TNO) is a minor planet within the Solar System which orbits the Sun at an average distance greater than that of Neptune (> 30.1 astronomical units; au). \n",
    "The population of TNOs is scientifically valuable because they are largely intact relics from the era of planetary formation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the current model explaining the formation of the outer Solar System, the small building blocks of planets, called planetesimals, that eventually became TNOs can be categorized into two broad groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outwardly Migrated \"Hot\" TNOs.**\n",
    "Some planetesimals formed within the inner region of the protoplanetary disk, located at a distance less than 30 au from the Sun. \n",
    "These planetesimals were later pushed outward by interactions with a migrating Neptune. \n",
    "As a result, they acquired dynamically \"hot\" orbits, meaning their inclination distribution\n",
    "includes high inclination objects (beyond 5 degrees), with a wide range of eccentricities. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Situ \"Cold\" TNOs.**\n",
    "Other planetesimals formed directly in the trans-Neptunian region, \n",
    "where they remain with dynamically \"cold\" orbits (inclinations < 5 degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Dynamical classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 3, clustering within plots of eccentricity or inclination versus semi-major axis\n",
    "will be used to illustrate the following TNO dynamical classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resonant TNOs** are currently found in stable mean motion resonances with Neptune, meaning they have a specific orbital relationship with the planet. \n",
    "It is presumed that they were transported outward while maintaining their resonant positions as Neptune migrated during the early history of the Solar System.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scattering TNOs** can have orbits extending to large distances, but their orbits are currently experiencing significant variations due to perturbations caused by Neptune when their closest distance to the Sun (perihelia $q$) is less than approximately 40 au, closest to Neptune. \n",
    "Scattering TNOs are believed to be remnants of a population that was scattered during the early formation of the Solar System and have managed to survive for a long time, and whose orbits are experiencing evolution, primarly due to Neptune. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Detached TNOs**, in contrast, have higher perihelia and are dynamically independent from Neptune, as they currently maintain stable orbits that are not significantly influenced by Neptune's gravitational effects.\n",
    "Detached TNOs might have originated as Scattering TNOs whose perihelia were raised through past resonance interactions with Neptune or through interactions with a distant, massive planet in the outer Solar System (though this hypothetical planet has not been observed yet). \n",
    "This class of TNOs is among the most enigmatic one, and the questions about where they formed and how they got to their orbits are still open.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extreme TNOs** are characterized by their exceptional distances from the Sun, with semi-major axes ($a$) exceeding 150 au (note that definitions may vary slightly) and $q > 40$ au.\n",
    "The formation mechanism responsible for producing these distant extreme TNOs remains unclear.\n",
    "One prominent hypothesis involves the presence of a massive object often referred to as \"Planet X\" or \"Planet 9\" situated at approximately 400 - 800 au from the Sun.\n",
    "The gravitational influence of this hypothetical Neptune-mass planet could have played a significant role in sculpting the distribution of these extreme TNOs, leading to the anisotropies observed in their orbital characteristics. Note that the \"extreme\" class is composed of a mix of \"scattering\" and \"detached\" objects, and is only meanigful in the presence of \"Planet 9/X\" - if there’s no \"Planet 9/X\", the \"extreme\" class is not required; see [Batygin et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PhR...805....1B/abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical TNOs** correspond to objects that are not in any of the previous classes, and are situated between Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 mean motion resonances, at distances ranging from 39 to 47 au, and characterized by low eccentricity ($e \\lesssim 0.24$) and inclination ($i \\lesssim$ 5 degrees). \n",
    "This group is a mix of two types of objects: some are native and remained dynamically \"cold,\" while others were originally \"hot\" objects that migrated into this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Comets\n",
    "In addition to the TNO dynamical classes, the DP0.3 simulation also includes other types of solar System objects such as long-period comets, and they will also be visualized in section 4. **Comets** are icy objects in space with irregular shapes that orbit the sun in highly-elliptical paths. They come in two types: short-period comets (less than 200 years to orbit) found in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune (30 au - 50 au), and long-period comets (over 200 years) that have more random paths and are thought to come from the Oort cloud, far away from the Sun. The Oort cloud has not been directly observed, but scientists believe it contains many icy objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 References\n",
    "\n",
    "The above information was compiled from the following refrences:\n",

    "The $H$ and $G$ magnitudes in different filters can reveal the surface properties and composition of asteroids.\n",
    "The $H$ magnitude is specifically used for objects that primarily reflect sunlight, such as asteroids, since their brightness depends on their distance from the Sun and the observer, \n",

    "\n",
    "Plot histograms of the two orbital elements that have not yet been explored:\n",
    "the longitude of the ascending node (`node`; degrees) and the argument of the perihelion (`peri`; degrees). These will be \"Histogram 1\" and \"Histogram 2\" below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a logarithmic scale in the y-axis to simultaneously show the different populations.\n",

    "Notice that the distributions for both the `node` and the `peri` for \"Classical\", \"Detached\", \"Scattering\",  and \"Other\" are all quite flat, but that the distribution for the \"Extreme\" objects  seem to be clustered at certain values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent clustering in longitude of perihelion `node` and ascending node `peri` of \"extreme\" TNOs motivated the hypothesis that the solar system contains a 5–10 Earth-mass planet (Planet X/Planet 9) at 400–800 times Earth's distance from the Sun ([Trujillo & Sheppard 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.507..471T/abstract); [Batygin & Brown 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/abstract); [Batygin et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PhR...805....1B/abstract)). \n",

    "However, this hypothesis is still under debate (e.g., [Napier et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2...59N/abstract)), and a statistical analysis that demonstrates whether this apparent clustering could be attributed to small-numbers of objects or not is beyond the scope of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, caution must be exercised when interpreting these results, as the observed clustering could potentially stem from a selection bias. It may be an artifact of the type of model used as inputs for Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in the \"MPCORB\" catalog. This catalog is a hybrid one that employs a pre-defined population model known as the \"Synthetic Solar System Model, S3M\" [Grav et al. 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/659833/meta), wherein model objects are replaced with real, existing objects currently listed in the Minor Planet Center. Consequently, the statistics are influenced by the S3M properties. While the model adequately produces populations for TNOs, it does not fully capture the properties of certain solar system objects, such as \"extreme\" TNOs, many of which have been discovered since 2011 (after the paper's publication) thanks to surveys like _OSSOS_ or _DES_.\n",

Note, however, that some dynamical families have higher albedos than others ([Vilenius et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A..94V/abstract)).\n",

    "The distributions of TNO orbital parameters and properties, such as the absolute magnitude $H$, offer valuable insights into the physical characteristics and evolution of various TNO dynamical classes. Additionally, they contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of the Solar System as a whole. While a detailed interpretation of the reasons behind these distribution differences among the various TNO dynamical classes and how they relate to different formation models exceeds the scope of this tutorial, it remains an ongoing area of research in planetary science.

    "## 5. Visualize a TNO in the deep drilling field\n",
    "\n",
    "Since TNOs are located at a considerable distance from Earth, they exhibit slow motion across the sky, with shifts as small as a few degrees over the 10-year duration of the LSST. The [LSST Deep Drilling Fields](https://www.lsst.org/scientists/survey-design/ddf), each covering an area equivallent to the field-of-view of the LSST Camera (9.6 square degrees), receive thousands of visits or observations throughout the 10-year survey period. Consequently, a single TNO can accumulate a substantial number of observations due to its extended visibility over this extended timeframe. In this section we will follow Section 2 of DP0.3 Portal Tutorial 3, and select a particular TNO from the `dp03_catalogs_10yr.DiaSource` catalog to visualize its orbit in space as a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll do a query that will get all the TNOs with the most number of observations, singling out a particular TNO with `ssObjectId = -735085100561880491`. We will also select `midPointMjdTai`, which is the effective mid-exposure time for this source (in days) to illustrate how the object moves across the sky.  "
