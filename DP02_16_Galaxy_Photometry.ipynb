    "\n",
    "Numerous photometry measurements are produced by the LSST Pipelines. Two types of photometry are there: The first are total fluxes are those that integrate the total light coming from objects, corrected for loss due to the blurring effects of PSF or seeing, including \"Composite Model\" (`cModel`) fluxes. The second category characterize the relative brightness of objects for specific regions of objects (i.e. are not corrected to be total fluxes) but can be useful for measuring accurate light profiles or accurate colors.\n",

    "For most cases the fixed cModel photometry are preferred to that with more degrees of freedom labeled `<f>_free_cModelFlux`. The difference is that the default uses a reference band where the galaxy is well detected to determine the other parameters, which are then fixed when fitting for the flux in the other bands. The `_free_cModelFlux` measurement allows all parameters to be free independent in each filter. The fixed `_cModelFlux` measurements are generally recommended for galaxy science applications where total flux measurements are needed (e.g. for intrinsic luminosity or mass).\n",

While aperture fluxes are not corrected for the loss outside the aperture, if the aperture size is much larger than the galaxy size then it will approximate the total flux of the galaxy.

The main goal of this method is to measure accurate colors while accounting for the different spatial resolution between filters. This is sometimes done by convolving all images to the largest PSF, but this process is computationally very time consuming for large images. It is not a measure of total flux in a filter. Several apertures are available. For photometric redshifts, and other analysis where accurate colors are important, it is the GaaP fluxes with optimal aperture that should be used. \n",

    "The above plots show that blending and contamination of flux by neighbors can result in inaccurate flux among the strong outliers, but does not cause the systematic overestimate in magnitude by Kron measurements at intermediate magnitudes. However, it is also the case that nearly none of these overestimated sources are isolated (they are blended with neibors). Large galaxy radius does increase with brightness but otherwise does not seem to give rise to the offset. (TBD: otherwise perhaps its the case that kron is not a good measure of multi-component light profiles, and the sum of 2 sersic models does a better job? Not sure how to test that. Andreon et al. 2002 says \"the 2MASS isophotal mag misses some 0.1 mag with respect the Kron–like mag listed in the 2MASS database, which in turn misses about 0.15 mag with respect the true Kron mag (because computed on a too small object region), which in turn misses 5 to 10% of the total flux.).\""
