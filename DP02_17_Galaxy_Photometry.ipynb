    "\n",
    "Photometry is the measurement of how much light is apparent from astronomical sources. The amount of light arriving on the telescope from the object is typically referred to as the flux density, or apparent magnitude (depending on units). Flux density is defined as the amount of energy arriving on the telescope per unit area, per unit time, per unit frequency (or wavelength) of the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSST Science Pipelines makes a variety of photometric measurements for point-like and extended sources. This notebook will teach the user about the automated photometry measurements that are measured on the deepCoadd images and appear in the Object Catalog as part of the LSST pipelines data products. The focus will be on galaxies, and thus is distinct from the demonstrations in DP0.2 Tutorial Notebooks 12a (about PSF data products) and 12b (a PSF science demo).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that these explanations are specific to DP0.2: the `objectTable` contents and definitions are still subject to change for DP1. The photometry in the catalog are flux densities in units of nano-Jansky [nJy]. 1 Jy = 10^{-23} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz.\n"

    "## 1.1 Types of photometry measurements in the Object Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema for the object catalog for DP0.2 <a href=\"https://sdm-schemas.lsst.io/dp02.html\">is available here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous photometry measurements are produced by the LSST Pipelines. Two types of photometry are there. The first are total fluxes (see Section 1.1.1), which aim to approximate (or model) all of the light coming from objects. Measurements that approximate total flux are \"Composite Model\" (cModel) fluxes. The second class of fluxes are measured inside an on-sky aperture but not corrected for flux that may fall outside: thus they are apparent fluxes but do not recover the intrisic (total) flux (see Section 1.1.2). The apparent fluxes are optimized for other purposes, such as for measuring accurate light profiles or accurate colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Total fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Composite Model (CModel) fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar in nature to those measured for SDSS (information <a href=\"https://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/magnitudes.php#cmodel\">available here</a>). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it is the linear combination of the best fit exponential (disk or D) and de Vaucouleurs (bulge or B) profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<f>_cModelFlux    : Flux from the final cmodel fit. Forced on <f>-band.\n",
    "<f>_cModelFluxErr : Uncertainty of <f>_cModelFlux\n",
    "<f>_cModel_flag   : Failure flag for <f>_cModelFlux\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For most cases the \"fixed\" cModel photometry (as listed above) are preferred to that measured with more degrees of freedom labeled `<f>_free_cModelFlux`. The difference is that the fixed ones above uses a reference band (recorded as `refBand` in the schema) where the galaxy is well detected to determine the other parameters, which are then fixed when fitting for the flux in the other bands. The `_free_cModelFlux` measurement allows all parameters to be free and independent in each filter. The fixed `_cModelFlux` measurements are generally recommended for galaxy science applications where total flux measurements are needed (e.g. for intrinsic luminosity or mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Apparent fluxes (i.e. not corrected to the total flux)\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Kron fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "A decent summary of Kron fluxes <a href=\"https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March05/Graham/Graham2_6.html\">in the NED documentation</a>. The aperture used for the fluxes is 2.5 x R1 where R1 is the luminosity weighted radius (also called \"first moment\"; Kron et al. 1980).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<f>_kronFlux      : Flux from Kron Flux algorithm. Measured on <f>-band.\n",
    "<f>_kronFluxErr   : Uncertainty of <f>_kronFlux.\n",
    "<f>_kronFlux_flag : Failure flag for <f>_kronFlux.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kron radius, `<f>_kronRad`, is also available. In this case of LSST pipeline output, the Kron flux is not corrected for light that is emitted outside of the Kron aperture. While in many cases it will collect the majority of light, it will not be as accurate as the cModel for science cases requiring total flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aperture fluxes\n",
    "This contains the enclosed flux inside a given aperture (they are not corrected to total fluxes using an aperture correction that accounts for the flux falling outside the aperture). Fixed aperture size refers to the aperture radius in pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<f>_ap<pix>Flux     : Flux within <pix>-pixel aperture. Forced on <f>-band.\n",

    "<f>_ap<pix>FluxFlag : Failure flag for <f>_ap<pix>Flux.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For DP0.2, the apertures are 3, 6, 9, 12, 17, 25, 35, 50, and 70 pixels. In the column name, apertures are `03`, `06`, `09`, `12`, and so on. While aperture fluxes are not corrected for the loss outside the aperture, if the aperture size is much larger than the galaxy size then it will approximate the total flux of the galaxy. The general application of these measurements are for measuring radial profiles (see Section 4 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GaaP fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the Gaussian-aperture-and-PSF flux that is defined in <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...482.1053K/abstract\">Kuijken et al. 2008</a>. The main goal of this method is to measure accurate colors while accounting for the different spatial resolution between filters. This is sometimes achieved in other datasets by convolving all images to the largest PSF, but this process of PSF-matching is computationally very time consuming for large images, thus motivating GaaP as a faster alternative. It is not a measure of total flux in a filter. Several measurement apertures are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Aperture**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<f>_gaap<ap>Flux    : GaaP flux with <ap> aperture after multiplying the seeing aperture. Forced on <f>-band.\n",
    "<f>_gaap<ap>FluxErr : Uncertainty of <f>_gaap<ap>Flux.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the measurement apertures are 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 arcseconds. In the column name `<ap>` appears as `0p5`, `0p7`, etc. Multiplying by the \"seeing aperture\" refers to convolving the PSF with a kernel so that the PSF is as if the seeing were 1.15 arcseconds. This has the effect of smearing the images of all filters consistently so that the colors are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For photometric redshifts, and other analysis where accurate colors are important, it is recommended to use the GaaP fluxes with 1.0 aperture (optimal aperture was found to not perform as well, and should not be used). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PSF fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Fluxes derived using the model point-spread function (PSF) of the image. Since PSF fluxes are designed for unresolved sources (not the majority of galaxies) this notebook will not explore science applications for this type of photometry. Interested users can find more information in the PSF Tutorial notebooks 12a and 12b. \n",
