    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook targets for an advanced user who is interested in understanding phase curve fitting in DP0.3 in detail. This notebook will explicitly explore three different functional forms that are broadly used for modeling a phase curve of an asteroid, and make a comparison with the `H` and `G12` parameters stored in the `SSObject` table. Please refer to the Introduction of the companion tutorial notebook 04a for definition of the phase curve. Only the most relevent parts to this tutorial are repeated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the phase curve (reduced magnitude $H(α)$ as a function of phase angle $α$) enables measurement of the absolute magnitude, $H$, defined as the brightness at 0 phase angle. The functional form can depend on the data quality and type of object targeted. This tutorial will explore three functional forms that are relevant for understanding the DP0.3 data products: `HG_model`, `HG1G2_model`, and `HG12_model`. The `HG_model` is the simplest model, and has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(α)=H−2.5log_{10}[(1−G)Φ_1(α)+GΦ_2(α)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Φ_n$ are basis functions (which allow for one to model non-linearity in the data, but maintain linearity in the fitted parameters). $Φ_n$ are normalized to unity at α=0 deg. This model provides a best fit for the slope parameter $G$ (from which surface properties can then be derived) and the absolute magnitude $H$. $H$(α) is the reduced magnitude at a given phase angle α if measured at 1 au away from both Earth and from the Sun (i.e. unit topocentric and heliocentric distance). The `HG_model` $G$ and $H$ values are stored in the `dp03_catalogs_10yr.MPCORB` table. For further info on the `HG_model`, see [Bowell et al. 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989aste.conf..524B/abstract). \n",
    "\n",
    "To better accommodate various observational effects (e.g., photometric quality, incomplete phase angle sampling) the more sophisticated `HG1G2_model` (a linear three-parameter function) and its nonlinear two-parameter version `HG12_model` were developed (see [Muinonen et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Icar..209..542M/abstract)). The `HG1G2_model` has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(α)=H−2.5log_{10}[G_1Φ_1(α)+G_2Φ_2(α) + (1-G_1-G_2)Φ3(α)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which now has three free parameters, $H$, $G_1$ and $G_2$. However, a third representation, the `HG12_model`, is generally very effective for deriving reliable values of absolute magnitude when the phase angle sampling is not optimal (e.g., poor phase angle coverage at a range of phase angle). Thus, the LSST data products will compute estimated parameters of the `HG12_model` and this will be the focus of this tutorial. The `HG12_model` expresses the $G_1$ and $G_2$ parameters as a piecewise linear function of a single parameter, $G_{12}$, \n",
    "\n",
    "for $G_{12}$ > 0.2,\n",
    "$$G_1 = 0.9529\\times G_{12} + 0.02162,$$\n",
    "$$G_2 = -0.6125\\times G_{12} + 0.5572,$$\n",
    "for $G_{12}$ < 0.2,\n",
    "$$G_1 = 0.7527\\times G_{12} + 0.06164,$$\n",
    "$$G_2 = -0.9612\\times G_{12} + 0.6270.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an illustrative example of deriving the phase curve of Main Belt asteroids using DP0.3 simulated catalogs. In Section 2, we will retrieve the necessary data from the DP0.3 database. Section 3 will delve into manual phase curve fitting for a single object using three different parametrizations of the phase curve model. In Section 4, we will then compare this manual fitting to the automated phase curve fitting carried out as part of the LSST data products, which are available in the SSObject table."

    "As mentioned in Section 2.2, the DP0.3 phase curve simulations were based on the `mpcH` and `mpcG` parameters stored in the `MPCORB` table using the `HG_model`. On the other hand, the simulated LSST observations of phase curves were fitted using the `HG12_model` and the resulting `H` and `G12` parameters are stored in the `SSObject` table. This Section compares those phase curve parameters provided in the DP0.3 tables to the manually-driven parameters using the `sbpy` package in this tutorial. "

The left panel shows the difference of $\\sim$0.02 between the input slope `G` and the output slope `G` guided by the red solid lines in all four filters. As shown in the right panel, the distributions of out-in absolute magnitude `H` are more complicated. Recall that `mpcH` is reported in $V$ band; the conversion from Rubin filters to $V$ is summarized in <a href=\"https://dp0-3.lsst.io/data-products-dp0-3/data-simulation-dp0-3.html#synthetic-object-populations\">Table 1 of the DP0.3 documentation</a>. The filter conversion can not fully explain the offsets seen in the out-in distributions (the table of filter conversions between V-band and LSST at the link above are never more than 0.4, but the right-hand panel shows g-bad with an offset of >0.4).
