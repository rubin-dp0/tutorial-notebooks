    " 1. HoloViews works with a wide range of plotting libraries, Bokeh, matplotlib, plotly, mpld3, pygal to name a few. You can change the HoloViews plotting library to be `matplotlib` instead of `bokeh` in Section 1 (e.g., `hv.extension('matplotlib')`; notice the holoviews + matplotlib icons displayed when the library is loaded successfully), and try running through Section 3 again. You will encounter some warnings about how certain options \"for Image type not valid for selected backend\", but you will also see the image display formats change to matplotlib. Try it, or try with some other plotting library. Don't forget to set the plotting library back to whichever you prefer to use for the rest of this tutorial.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. In Section 3.1, try using the coadd image instead of the calexp image. \n",
    " \n",
    " 3. In Section 3.3, try extracting additional information about the Sources and adding it to the custom hover tool. For example, the corresponding RA/DEC or the PSF flux.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Try using a different stream function to interact with the images in Section 3.4.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. Try outputting an interactive HTML file (like what was done in Section 3.2) for the interactive images in Section 3.3 and 3.4.  How much of of the interactive functionality from the notebook version of these images carries over to the HTML files?  (N.B.:  the `box` functionality from Section 3.4 does not seem to be supported in an interactive HTML file.)"
